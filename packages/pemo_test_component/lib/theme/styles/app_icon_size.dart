/// Defines the standard icon sizes for the application.
///
/// This class provides a set of predefined icon sizes to ensure consistency
/// across the user interface. These values can be used for the `size` property
/// of the `Icon` widget or for custom icon implementations.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// Icon(
///   Icons.favorite,
///   size: AppIconSize.x6,
/// )
/// ```
abstract class AppIconSize {
  /// An icon size of 4.0 logical pixels.
  static const double x1 = 4.0;

  /// An icon size of 8.0 logical pixels.
  static const double x2 = 8.0;

  /// An icon size of 12.0 logical pixels.
  static const double x3 = 12.0;

  /// An icon size of 16.0 logical pixels.
  static const double x4 = 16.0;

  /// An icon size of 20.0 logical pixels.
  static const double x5 = 20.0;

  /// An icon size of 24.0 logical pixels.
  static const double x6 = 24.0;

  /// An icon size of 28.0 logical pixels.
  static const double x7 = 28.0;

  /// An icon size of 32.0 logical pixels.
  static const double x8 = 32.0;

  /// An icon size of 36.0 logical pixels.
  static const double x9 = 36.0;

  /// An icon size of 40.0 logical pixels.
  static const double x10 = 40.0;

  /// An icon size of 44.0 logical pixels.
  static const double x11 = 44.0;

  /// An icon size of 48.0 logical pixels.
  static const double x12 = 48.0;
